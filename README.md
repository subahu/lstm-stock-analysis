# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Prediction Using Stacked LSTM

This project applies **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks to predict **Apple (AAPL) stock prices** based on historical data. LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that excels in **time-series forecasting**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Loads and processes** Apple stock market data (`AAPL.csv`).
- **Uses LSTM** to model and predict stock prices.
- **Stacked LSTM architecture** for improved accuracy.
- **Data Visualization** (closing prices, moving averages).
- **Performance Evaluation** using RMSE and accuracy metrics.

## ðŸš€ Installation
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn
